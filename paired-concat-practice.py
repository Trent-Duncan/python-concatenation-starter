# Concatenation Practice


# Work with your assigned partner
# Each person in your team should take turns writing the code to create and display longer strings
# Check your partner's code for spelling, capitalization, and coding errors
# Correct any bugs in your code

# Part 1
# Create variables to store your first, middle, and last name
# Have Python print a message that contains your concatenated full name, i.e., your combined first, middle and last names
first_name= 'Trent '
middle_name= 'neilson '
last_name= 'Duncan '
first_name_2 = ' Matthew '
middle_name_2 = 'Wayne '
last_name_2 = 'Hall '
print(first_name + middle_name + last_name + "and" + first_name_2 + middle_name_2 + last_name_2)

# Part 2
# Assume you're building a Space Invaders game
# Use concatenation to create and display a custom welcome message that includes the player's first name
print ('welcome to my Space Invaders game Matthew!')

# Part 3
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that includes your first name, last name, and the year you were born
birth_year=2008
print(first_name + middle_name + last_name + "was born in the year " + str(birth_year) + ".")


# Part 4
# Use concatenation to create and display a sentence that says which country in the world
# you would visit if money were no object
country= ' nowhere'
print("if i could go anywhere i'd go" + country)
